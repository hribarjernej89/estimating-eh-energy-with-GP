# Estimating Energy From Solar Panels Using Gaussian Processes

In the notebook we use the measurment obtained from the dataset described in [A Testbed and an Experimental Public Dataset for Energy-Harvested IoT Solutions](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/337362922_A_Testbed_and_an_Experimental_Public_Dataset_for_Energy-Harvested_IoT_Solutions) and is available for download [here](https://github.com/UCLM-ARCO/energy-harvesting-dataset). This notebook is part of our work: **Analyse or Transmit: Utilising Correlation at the Edge with Deep Reinforcement Learning** accepted for presentation at the IEEE Globecom 2021, Madrid Spain.
